# Pokemon Memory Game 
Small front-end only project using React. The game tests user memory by picking a pokemon card on the screen.
When the user picks pokemon that was picked previously the game will end. Each time user succesfully picks unique pokemon a score is added. 
Both current and best score is displayed on the screen. 

# Project Aim
To create seamless UI/UX experience. 
Focus for project was to create a web app that is responsive and able to handle multiple device screen size using a bottom up approach. This was achieved mainly through CSS/SASS escpecially utilizing Sass's `mixins`.
Another focus was to create a clean and re-usable code making it readable and understand the code and logics easily. 

I also wanted to get familiarised with Figma and it was used to first plant an overall picture and flow of the project.

I also wanted implement and use other React hooks like `suspense`, `useMemo`, `redux` and etc.
